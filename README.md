# final-project

## overall objective of this project: 
I'm always interested in data visualization and want to put some effort on it; for me, data visualization is not only about pretty graphs to see, but also it's necessary to provide interesting interactions for users. This interactive media final project aims to provide an intuitive and dynamic bubble chart to give meaningful information about New Yorker social media usage across different platforms. The bigger the bubble is, the more users the platform has. Users are allowed to hover on the bubbles and when the mouse is on one bubble, then the bubble will get twice big. The intended audience can be everyone and anyone, and I think the idea can be applied to a variety of areas and industries.

## Design Inspiration:
I got some inspirations from online resources such as open-source governmental data, Youtube tutorial and D3 (Data-Driven Documents) framework. The links include the following:

## Technical Execution:
I tried lots of different solutions in this project and many trade-offs were going on here as well.
First of all, since the bar chart is the easiest way to make a data visualization, I tried to make some very basic and simple bars using D3 framework so that I can get more and more familiar with the new knowledge.
Then I started to think about what kind of chart I want to make, which can express the data clearly, and can also have some interactions. Based on the balance of idea and the work-load level, I decided to choose bubble chart. It turns out a great outcome! Even though I've already finished the chart for this final project, but there're still a lot to do in the future. I can add more interactive actions into the website, such as buttons, showing hiding content, synthesizing them into a quatrant, etc. 

I watched youtube video a lot, since it's much easier for me to look through how the code is writen than looking at the whole bunch of code at the same time. I have my own pace when I teach myself. I think time management is a big issue here as well. I have to deal with many questions like what's the ultimate output? how can I divide my time into separate parts to finish things sequentially? What if I can't achieve this function, is there any back-up?

## This is the project I finished so far:

## Future development:
* Add more interactions on the bubble or the website in general, such as buttons, lines, forces, etc.
* Add more data visualization elements such as quadrant
* Try to pull data from API so to make it always keep updated along the time
